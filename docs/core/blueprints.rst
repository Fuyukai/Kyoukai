Blueprints
==========

.. versionadded:: 1.5

.. versionchanged:: 2.1.2

    Host Matching is now supported. See :ref:`hostmatching`.

In Kyoukai, routes are stored inside a tree structure consisting of multiple Blueprint objects with
a parent and children. Each Blueprint contains a group of routes stored on it, which inherit the
request hooks and the API prefix of all of its parents.

Blueprints are instantiated similar to app objects, with a name.

.. code-block:: python

    my_blueprint = Blueprint("my_blueprint")


Additionally, blueprints take an additional set of parameters which can be used to more finely
control the behaviour.

   - ``prefix``: The URL prefix to add to every request.
        For example, if this is set to ``/api/v1`, every request attached to this blueprint will
        only be accessible
        via ``/api/v1/<route>``.

A note on the tree
------------------

Blueprints are stored inside a tree structure - that means that all Blueprints have a parent
blueprint and 0 to N children blueprints.

When registering an error handler, or a request hook, children blueprints automatically inherit
these unless they are overridden on the child level.

Routing
-------

Routing with Blueprints is incredibly similar to routing with a bare app object. Internally, an
``@app.route`` maps to routing on an underlying Blueprint object used as the "root" blueprint.

.. code-block:: python

    @my_blueprint.route("/some/route")
    async def some_route(ctx: HTTPRequestContext):
        return "Some route"

.. automethod:: kyoukai.blueprint.Blueprint.route
    :noindex:

Error handlers
--------------

Error handlers with Blueprints are handled exactly the same as error handlers on bare app objects.
The difference between these however is that error handlers are local to the Blueprint and its
children.

.. code-block:: python

    @my_blueprint.errorhandler(500)
    async def e500(ctx: HTTPRequestContext, err: Exception):
        return "Handled an error"

.. automethod:: kyoukai.blueprint.Blueprint.errorhandler
    :noindex:


Registering blueprints
----------------------

If, after creating your blueprint, you attempt to navigate to ``/some/route`` you will find a
404 error living there instead. This is because you did not register the Blueprint to your
application.

.. code:: python

    app.register_blueprint(my_blueprint)

Internally, this adds a child to the root blueprint, and sets the parent of the child to the root
blueprint.
If you have a blueprint that you wish to inherit from, you must register your Blueprint as a child
of the Blueprint
you wish to inherit from.

.. code-block:: python

    my_blueprint.add_child(my_other_blueprint)

.. automethod:: kyoukai.app.Kyoukai.register_blueprint
    :noindex:

.. automethod:: kyoukai.blueprint.Blueprint.add_child
    :noindex:
