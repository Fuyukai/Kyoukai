Kyoukai (境界)
==============

About
-----

*Kyoukai* is a fast asynchronous Python server-side web microframework.
It is built upon :mod:`asyncio` and `Asphalt`_ for an easy to use web server.

Kyoukai is Flask inspired; it attempts to be as simple as possible, but
without underlying magic to make it confusing.

Installation
------------

Kyoukai depends heavily on the asyncio library provided by Python3.4+,
and certain language features added in Python 3.5. This means the
library is not compatible with code that does not use Python 3.5 or
above.

Kyoukai is shipped as a PyPI package, so can be installed easily with
pip.

::

    $ pip install kyoukai

Alternatively, if you want cutting edge, you can install directly from
git.

::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/SunDwarf/Kyoukai.git

**Note that the Git version is not guarenteed to be stable, at all.**
